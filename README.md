# PuttingZones
Keep track of putts in golf.

Putting green is divided into 7 areas. This app monitored where first putt landed.

## Idea
You should track your first putt on putting green. There are 7 zones where putt stops.

### Zone 0
Putt went on line, but it was just short.

### Zone 1
Putt stopped short and left.

### Zone 2
Putt stopped short and right.

### Zone 3
Distance was ok but ball stops left.

### Zone 4
Distance was ok but ball stops right.

### Zone 5
Distance was more than 17 inches past the hole  and the ball stops on the left side.

### Zone 6
Distance was more than 17 inches past the hole and the ball stops on the right side.
